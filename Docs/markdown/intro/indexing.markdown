## Indexing

RavenFS allows you to look for files by using [Lucene query syntax](http://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html). You can search a file by using:

* name
* size
* directory
* date of modification
* any metadata

Searching is supported by The Studio, where you will find very usefull predefined search filters:

You are also able to search from your code by using Client API.
